> This is my first every python project, so expect things to break, and also don't expect it to be the best code ever. I'm still learning! If you want you can contribute to this project by forking it and making a pull request. I would really appreciate it!

## Brief Description
Kenzo's Awesome Credits Checker is a simple cli python program, that takes json config files that contain information about Source Engine custom assets, and checks map files if these custom assets were used, so that you don't ever forget to credit someone!
